# ProjetoHitss

### Objective: 
This project was developed using React Native and Typescript as a challenge to learn how to deal with redux, redux sagas as well as Typescript. I also work with jest and react native testing library, so all of the components are tested and almost all of the redux part is tested as well.

### Helping

A special thanks to [Salom√£o](https://github.com/salomaoluiz) for helping me with testing and redux saga :raised_hands:	!

### Some final thoughts for now:

This project isn't finished yet, but for now i will be learning more UI/UX testing and infra related stuff so i can go back to this project and improve on what i already have. Any constructive criticism is welcome. 

Tks for your time!
